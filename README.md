# GetHostnameFromIP
Provide a single row csv with ipv4 addresses that the script will iterate over and output the corresponding Hostnames 

Supply a textfile with hostnames and the script will try and resolve it into an ip adress and output the data into a file called results.csv

Example: Python3 GetHostname.py listofIP.csv

**The text file can only contain IP's and nothing more.
